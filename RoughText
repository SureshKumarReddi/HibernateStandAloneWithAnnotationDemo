HQL (Hibernate Query Language,Query Object) differs from sql

-An object-oriented representation of a Hibernate query. 
-A Query instance is obtained by calling Session.createQuery().

*** differences *****


- Instead of using tableName in HQL we are  using className
- Instead of using columnName in HQl we are using classPropertyName
- there is no select * from , in HQl we are starting from className

 eg: Query query = session.createQuery("from Student where id>2");
 
 -Instead of returning records from database ,in HQL we are returning list .
 
 eg:List list = query.list();
 
 
 problems with HQL
 ----------------
 
 - 1.if query is complex difficult to change for existing queries .
 - use criteria API
 
 
 ***************
 
 NamedQueries:(javabrains)
 
 - NamedQueries are used for writing common queries at entity level 
 and can be accessed where ever we need to call
 - it actually uses HQL query 
 - one advantage of Named Queries is it allows write sql quries using 
 NamedNativeQuery(name = "" , query ="select * from tablename")
